# Makefile
> Makefile is a program building tool which runs on Unix, Linux, and their flavors. It aids in simplifying building program executables that may need various modules. 

```
make -n
% 
# '%' matches any target.
$<
# '$<' is patterned to match prerequisites.
$@  
# '$@' matches the target
```
